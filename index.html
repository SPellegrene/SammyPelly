    <div class="small-border"></div>
    <p class="content-description">Through my intensive educational experience with
      The Iron Yard, I was trained in the importance of
      dynamic web exerpiences. I understand that a
      website is not just a page for company information.
      A web experience is a window into the soul of an
      orgnaizations culture. Without it, customers struggle
      to define who you are. This is the most important
      sentiment learned and one I am commited to grow in
      as my career progresses.</p>

    <h5 class="content-title">THE 80/20 RULE</h5>
    <div class="small-border"></div>
    <p class="content-description">Many say the customer is always right. I
      would disagree and say that most of the time,
      consumers do not know what they want.
      It is the job of a brand to aid in these desires.
      While working in the music industry and at Arrow,
      I learned the 80/20 rule. Give the customer 80%
      of something they recognize and 20% of something
      brand new. I have tried to practice this rule
      within my own music, as well as in my development
      practices.</p>

    <div class="small-border"></div>
    <p class="content-description">I began writing and recording at
      the early age of 12 years old. Since then I have
      toured nationally with record labels and pitched
      songs to some of musics biggest performers.
      Through these experiences I have developed a
      love for travel and public speaking. I also
      recognize the patience one must have with creative
      mediums, which is why I have found such a home in
      front-end development.</p>
